## What is Arcadia?

`Arcadia` displays smooth arcs around your character in the middle of the screen to inform you about the `health` and `power` (`mana`, `rage`, ...) of you, your pet, and your target. In addition, it shows casts, combo points, holy power, soul shards, and a couple of other things. It discretely fades when you are out of combat and at full health/power.

## Why Arcadia?

`Arcadia` is a fork of the popular `ArcHUD3` addon by `nyyr`. The project had
become stale despite its popularity. Unfortunately, it was difficult to contact the original author and ask for permission to transfer ownership of the project and use of its name.

WoW addon development typically followed a paradigm that is outdated in comparison to moden software development practices. This project restructures the codebase to be more maintainable and extensible. Happy days! üéâ
