## What is Arcadia?

`Arcadia` displays smooth arcs around your character in the middle of the screen to inform you about the `health` and `power` (`mana`, `rage`, ...) of you, your pet, and your target. In addition, it shows casts, combo points, holy power, soul shards, and a couple of other things. It discretely fades when you are out of combat and at full health/power.
